# suqo-claude-plugin

Claude Code plugin that ships skills for building apps on top of the **SUQO SDKs**.

## What this is

This repo is a Claude Code plugin (and its own marketplace source), so it can be installed with:

```
/plugin marketplace add Code-Pros-AI/suqo-claude-plugin
/plugin install suqo-claude-plugin
```

Once installed, Claude loads the relevant skill on its own when a developer asks for SUQO work — no explicit invocation needed, though `/php-sdk-usage` and friends still work.

## Skills

| Skill | Triggers on |
|---|---|
| `php-sdk-usage` | Any PHP work with the SUQO PHP SDK — products, subscriptions, paging, webhook verification, client wiring, error handling, testing. |
| `ts-sdk-usage` | Building with the SUQO TypeScript SDK. *(Scaffold — references and templates not written yet.)* |

Each skill is self-contained: `SKILL.md` carries the workflow and the rules that
are easy to get wrong, `references/` holds the detail Claude loads only when the
task needs it, and `templates/` holds code to adapt rather than write from
scratch.

One skill per SDK, deliberately. Splitting PHP into separate usage/webhook/test
skills meant three overlapping `description` fields competing to be selected;
one skill with a chunked `references/` folder picks itself reliably and still
loads only the page a task needs.

## Adding more skills

Add new skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` following the same pattern. Keep this repo as the single place we ship all SUQO Claude skills from — don't spin up separate plugin repos per skill.

Conventions worth keeping:

- `name` in the frontmatter matches the directory name, lowercase and hyphenated.
- `description` says *when* to use the skill and names the trigger phrases a
  developer would actually type — that text is all Claude sees when deciding
  whether to load it.
- Keep `SKILL.md` short enough to hold in context. Push detail into
  `references/`, one file per topic, and index them in a table.
- Templates are real, runnable files, not sketches. Lint them (`php -l`) and,
  where they are tests, run them.
- State the API surface exactly and tell Claude not to invent methods. The PHP
  skills' `references/api-surface.md` exists for that reason.
